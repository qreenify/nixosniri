## ðŸ“š Learning Path

### Week 1: Basic Navigation
1. Practice moving with `h j k l` instead of arrow keys
2. Use `w` (word forward) and `b` (word back)
3. Try `0` (start of line) and `$` (end of line)

### Week 2: Editing
1. Learn the verbs: `d` (delete), `c` (change), `y` (yank/copy)
2. Combine with motions: `dw` (delete word), `ciw` (change in word)
3. Use visual mode: `v` for character, `V` for line, `Ctrl+v` for block

### Week 3: Advanced
1. Practice surround commands
2. Use `.` to repeat last action
3. Learn macros: `qa` to start recording, `q` to stop, `@a` to replay

### Week 4: Customization
1. Explore Telescope thoroughly
2. Customize your keybindings in `~/claude/modules/home.nix`
3. Add LSP servers for your languages

## ðŸŽ“ Tips

- **Press Space and wait** - Let which-key teach you!
- **Don't try to learn everything** - Master one thing at a time
- **Use what you know** - It's okay to use mouse/arrow keys while learning
- **Practice daily** - Muscle memory takes time

## ðŸ”§ Common Tasks

### Opening Files
```
n filename.txt          # Open from terminal
:e filename.txt         # Open from within nvim
Space + ff              # Find and open with fuzzy search
```

### Multiple Files
```
:vs filename.txt        # Open in vertical split
:sp filename.txt        # Open in horizontal split
Ctrl + h/j/k/l          # Move between splits
```

### Search and Replace
```
/pattern                # Search forward
?pattern                # Search backward
n / N                   # Next/previous match
:%s/old/new/g           # Replace all in file
:'<,'>s/old/new/g       # Replace in selection
```

## ðŸš€ Power User Tips

1. **Use relative line numbers** - Jump with `10j` (10 lines down)
2. **Master text objects** - `ci"` (change inside quotes), `da{` (delete around braces)
3. **Learn marks** - `ma` to set mark 'a', `'a` to jump back
4. **Use registers** - `"ayy` to yank to register 'a', `"ap` to paste

## ðŸ†˜ Getting Help
